## Release Summary

### Version
- Previous: v1.0.0
- New: v1.0.2
- Type: PATCH (bug fixes)

### Key Changes

**Bug Fixes:**
- **SVG Extraction (debt-001)** - `extractSVG()` now throws a clear error instead of returning raw content when no valid SVG is found. Prevents displaying AI explanations as "SVG code".
- **Model Race Condition (debt-006)** - Fixed race condition where concurrent SVG generation requests with different models could interfere. Models now passed per-request instead of via shared state.

**Infrastructure:**
- **PromptLoader Service (feature-001)** - Centralized system prompt management via `resources/system-prompts/` directory with caching support.
- **SVG Architect Prompts** - Placeholder prompts for upcoming multi-agent SVG generation pipeline (shelved for now).

**Documentation:**
- Added "What's New in v1.0.2" section to README.md

### Statistics
- Commits since v1.0.0: 11
- New tests added: 67 (32 for race condition, 16 for SVG extraction, 19 for PromptLoader)
- Total tests: 140 passing

## Pre-Release Review

A parallel code review was conducted using 4 subagents:

| Review Area | Status | Findings |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| AI Clients | PASS | Race condition fix is backwards compatible. `setModel()` soft-deprecated with fallback. |
| SVGOrchestrator | PASS | No API changes. Better error handling. |
| PromptLoader | PASS | New service, properly isolated. Instantiated but unused (foundation work). |
| Test Coverage | PASS | 140/140 tests passing. Excellent coverage for race condition fix. |

**Verdict:** No breaking changes. Safe for release.

## Branch Cleanup

Performed prior to release:
- Deleted remote sprint branches (merged into `epic/svg-architect/full`)
- Deleted local orphan branches (`feature/image-svg-as-text`, `svg-attach`)
- Kept `epic/svg-architect/full` as archived integration branch

## Strategic Decision

Discussed separating Hugging Face integration into its own extension rather than adding it to Pixel Minion:

**Rationale:**
- Different UX paradigm (model-centric vs task-centric)
- Hugging Face has unique features (LoRAs, advanced parameters, model discovery)
- Better marketplace discoverability for HF users
- Independent iteration possible

**Decision:** Defer Hugging Face to separate extension project.

## Notes

- The vsix is large (67.73 MB) due to including docs/example-repo and node_modules
- Consider adding .vscodeignore in future to reduce package size
- SVG Architect feature shelved - complexity didn't justify results
